# Desription:
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Our task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.
